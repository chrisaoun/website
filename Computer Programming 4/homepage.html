      <h3><b>National</b> Parti québécois hopefuls debate English-language schooling in Québec</h3>
      <p>Parti québécois hopefuls debated today on the issue of an increasingly anglophone Québec. “There are different studies that said that with more francophones in the English CÉGEPs, then afterwards they’re more open to work in English and I think the working place in Québec should be in French,” Ouellet said. "Au Québec ça se passe en francais."

      <p>Our London correspondant has just reported to our main studio in Montréal that the Queen is a reptilian lizard! Sources claim that they saw the Queen momentarily morph into a green-like creature. "It was very terrifying. I thought she was possesed," says one bystander. This happened when the Queen was going to visit the First Minister of Scotland, who is also believed to be a repitle in disguise.</p>
